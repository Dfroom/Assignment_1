## Overview and Origin
Nanopay was founded in 2013 by Laurence Cooke, who left the telecommunications industry with the goal of changing the way payments are made. Cooke saw an industry with poor payment infrastructure and long processing times, with his experience from the telecommunications industry he knew there was a better way. After raising $350k of Seed money in October of 2013 nanopay went on to raise another $200k in a Venture round in October of 2015. Nanopay then acquired MintChip, a digital payment crypto-currency created by the Royal Canadian Mint, in January of 2016. Shortly after, in October of 2016, Nanopay raised $10M in a Series A round. To date Nanopay has raised $10.55M and has not raised any outside capital since October of 2016. Nanopay has been a very innovative company in the Canadian FinTech space and has been fascinating to watch.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Bringing fast, secure, and compliant payment infrastructure to the masses.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Three areas of business: Treasury, Banks, and Businesses. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

MintChip

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
CLT Hybrid Blockchain

Nanopay was founded to combat slow, inefficient, and outdated payment infrastructure. As such it has three intended customers: Treasuries, Banks, and Businesses. Nanopay has been succesful in courting these customers and todate has numerous partnerships including those with Interac, BMO, RBC, Scotiabank, flinks, Intuit Quickbooks, and the National Bank of Pakistan. Nanopay uses a Centralized Ledger Technology and a Hybrid Blockchain to offer a reduced cost with the security of an immutable ledger, simplified governance, and faster payments than a decentralized ledger. Their acquisition of MintChip provided Nanopay with an advantage over competitors as MintChip was government developed, is tied to the Canadaian dollar, and compliant with Canadian, and many foreign, regulations.
## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Payment Processing

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

CBDCs and crypto currencies

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Bank of Canada's Jasper, R3 (Corda), Crypto-currencies (Bitcoion, StableCoins, etc.) 

While Nanopay offers solutions to to treasuries and other government institutions they are primarily in the payment processing domain of the financial industry. This segment of the industry has seen many advancements and innovations over the past decade, including Crypto-Currencies, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), machine learning, artificial intellegence, Blockchain, and "Stable Coins" and more. While many of these technologies pose a potential threat to Nanopay, they have utilized many of these technologies in their solutions. Their acquisition of MintChip a Royal Canadian Mint created cryptocurrency, of sorts, was in many respects a type of CBDC; while their use of Blockchain with a centralized ledger allows for quick payment processing. While Nanopay has doen an incredible job in integrating new technologies to "Build(ing) the operating system for money" they face stiff competition. projects like the bank of Cnada's Jasper aim to create CBDCs to be used throughout their country's financial system, decentralized ledger Crypto-Currencies like Bitcoin seek to replace fiat all together, "Stable Coins" like USDT try to tether or "peg" their Crypto-Currency to the USD or some other store of value, and companies like R3 have solutions like their Corda a Decentralized Ledger Technology competitor to Nanopay.
