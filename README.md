## Overview and Origin
Nanopay was founded in 2013 by Laurence Cooke, who left the telecommunications industry to change how payments are made. Cooke saw an industry with poor payment infrastructure and long processing times- with his experience in the telecommunications industry, he knew there was a better way. After raising $350k of Seed money in October 2013, Nanopay raised another $200k in a Venture round in October 2015. Nanopay then acquired MintChip, a digital payment crypto-currency created by the Royal Canadian Mint, in January 2016. Shortly after, in October 2016, Nanopay raised $10M in a Series A round.

Nanopay has raised $10.55M and has not raised any outside capital since October 2016. Nanopay has been a very innovative company in the Canadian FinTech space and has been fascinating to watch.
## Business Activities:
Nanopay was founded to combat slow, inefficient, and outdated payment infrastructure. It has three intended customers: Treasuries, Banks, and Businesses. Nanopay has successfully courted these customers and has numerous partnerships, including those with Interac, BMO, RBC, Scotiabank, Flinks, Intuit Quickbooks, and the National Bank of Pakistan.

Nanopay uses a Centralized Ledger Technology and a Hybrid Blockchain to offer a reduced cost with the security of an immutable ledger, simplified governance, and faster payments than a decentralized ledger. Their acquisition of MintChip gave Nanopay an advantage over competitors, as MintChip was government-developed, tied to the Canadian dollar, and compliant with Canadian and many foreign regulations.
## Landscape: 
While Nanopay offers solutions to treasuries and other government institutions, they are primarily in the payment processing domain of the financial industry.

This industry segment has seen many advancements and innovations over the past decade, including Crypto-Currencies, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), machine learning, artificial intelligence, Blockchain, "Stable Coins," and more. While many of these technologies potentially threaten Nanopay, they have utilized them in their solutions. Their acquisition of MintChip, a Royal Canadian Mint-created cryptocurrency, was a type of CBDC in many respects. At the same time, their use of Blockchain with a centralized ledger allows for quick payment processing.

While Nanopay has done an incredible job integrating new technologies to "Build(ing) the operating system for money," they face stiff competition. Projects like the Bank of Canada's Jasper aim to create CBDCs for use throughout their country's financial system, decentralized ledger Crypto-Currencies like Bitcoin seek to replace fiat altogether, "Stable Coins" like USDT try to tether or "peg" their Crypto-Currency to the USD or some other store of value, and companies like R3 have solutions like their Corda a Decentralized Ledger Technology competitor to Nanopay. The competition is heavy in this sector.
## Results
Nanopay has made an incredible impact! Their technology has allowed Interac to offer real-time payments and transfers from Canadian accounts to high-volume international corridors, the Brazillian company BePay to offer international remittances, the issuance of virtual cards, bank-to-bank payments, and businesses to issue and collect on invoices. Their services are paving the way for a future of "Fiat done digitally.".

While core metrics such as users, number of payments facilitated, total value of payments facilitated, revenue, growth, and more are significant indicators of such a company's performance and health, as a private company, Nanopay does release these figures publicly. We can look at what is publicly available for indicators of their performance. 

Nanopay has a small but dedicated group of 7 (publicly listed) investors, including Goldman Sachs. They have received several awards and endorsements, including "Blockchain Company of the Year" from the Canadian FiTech and AI awards in 2019, "One of Canada's Top 20 Most Innovative Technology Companies" in 2019, received impressive scores in the Federal Reserve's 2017 Faster Payments Task Force Report on Proposal to Help the United States Enact Faster Payments Technologies, and many more. Nanopay's domestic and international partnerships with reputable financial organizations are a meaningful vote of confidence in the company. 


While exact figures are unavailable, by looking at their achievements, partners, and awards, it's safe to say Nanopay has a bright future!
## Recommendations
I recommend that Nanopay launch a service for individual consumers like Wise (formerly Transfer Wise). Such a service would allow consumers to request, send, receive, and hold money worldwide in numerous currencies. Nanopay would benefit through public awareness of its brand, a broader user base, increased revenue/cash flow, and access to more diverse markets. Additionally, because of their current technologies and services, it would entail very little investment or added technology- it would only require the development of a relatively simple app for the consumer. Nanopay's existing technologies, such as their centralized ledger hybrid blockchain and virtual cards, are well suited for such an application.
